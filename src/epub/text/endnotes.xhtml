<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_1" id="Footnote_1">[1]</a> “Cho”, generally translated as “street,” is used in designating a
particular locality of town, including a street line and, often, its
neighbourhood.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_2" id="Footnote_2">[2]</a> “O-Tami don” is one of familiar ways of addressing people. “O”, one
of the honorific terms, carries often an endearing tone. “Don,” placed
after one’s name, is used generally among people of working or servant
classes in greeting one of their own number.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_3" id="Footnote_3">[3]</a> The value of gold pieces is hard to ascertain, as there were in
circulation coins minted in different ages, and their qualities were of
as different grades. However, one “ryo”, as the larger gold money was
termed, is about equivalent to a hundred yen according to the present
scale of currency and its purchasing power, or it is, at least, an
approximation as near as needed for our present purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_4" id="Footnote_4">[4]</a> “Chan” is used in accosting a person in an endearing way. “Tsu”, an
abbreviation for “Tsuya” as “Shin” is for “Shinsuké”, is an instance of
shortening a name in familiar speech.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_5" id="Footnote_5">[5]</a> The “Bon” holidays which fall on the middle of the seventh month
are observed in honor of the return of the dead souls to their former
earthly abode. It is still kept to this day not so much for general
religious fervor as a convenient time to mark off the first half
portion of the year. It is at this time and also just before or during
the New Year’s holidays, twice in a year, that people exchange presents
as greetings of the season. One who receives a call at such time by a
man below oneself generally acknowledges the same with small or large
tips.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_6" id="Footnote_6">[6]</a> Incorrectness in the manners or conduct of a man in a lower level
of culture or intellect, if not ill meant and not pushed too far, is
generally taken as a matter of course more or less, and treated as
such. Benevolence and understanding have always been regarded by the
Japanese as so much of virtue as well as the prerogative of a man in
a more favoured position of life. Thus it is seen why the boatman’s
manners, above described, coming so openly and frankly from a man who
knew no better, were accepted as a well-meant effort to amuse the
company at the expense of nobody but himself.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_7" id="Footnote_7">[7]</a> In old times the theatre generally opened at about 10 o’clock
in the morning, continuing until about 9 o’clock in the evening.
What of the distance to cover on foot and of this early performance,
theatre-goers had to leave their homes early and made a complete day
and evening of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_8" id="Footnote_8">[8]</a> When the succession of a family line was considered paramount, no
parents would agree to their heir or heiress marrying out of their
family. The eldest son succeeded to the family name and estate. In case
of a daughter being the only one to succeed, a man was chosen to marry
her and take her family name, so that it would not pass out for the
absence of a male child.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_9" id="Footnote_9">[9]</a> In old time the geisha was not permitted to wear foot-cover in
company of her guests, an idea to keep herself low out of her respect
for their lordly patronage. However, the custom was often looked on as
a privilege for a woman of dainty feet to indulge in.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_10" id="Footnote_10">[10]</a> “San”, used after one’s name, is an honorific term used in more
formal language and the one most used in accosting people.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_11" id="Footnote_11">[11]</a> Ten o’clock.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_12" id="Footnote_12">[12]</a> The 8th year of Bunsei was 1825 A.D.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_13" id="Footnote_13">[13]</a> “Hatamoto”, the Shogun’s bodyguards; therefore, the most honoured
amongst the “samurai” under the Shogunate regime.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_14" id="Footnote_14">[14]</a> It is customary that the husband calls his wife’s name without any
honorific term, whilst the wife addresses to him in a more honoured way.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_15" id="Footnote_15">[15]</a> “Saké”, drink made from rice and the most common drink among the
Japanese.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_16" id="Footnote_16">[16]</a> “Samisen” or, often pronounced “shamisen”, is a musical instrument
of three strings. It plays invariably a chief part in the music
entertainment given by the geisha.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="unindent"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_17" id="Footnote_17">[17]</a> “Katobushi”, a distinct musical product of “Yeddo civilization,”
is one of those tunes which are played secondary to the chanted words
often telling a dramatic episode or a tale complete in itself.
